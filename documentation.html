<a id="welcome-to-my-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-page" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

The functionality of RenewGrass can be summarized as follows:

<ul>
<li>Adapt Renew to handle scientific workflows</li>
<li>Provide Unskilled users by means for ease modeling of their workflows</li>
<li>Exploit the power of the Grass GIS, in order to implement various image processing workflows</li>
<li>Reduce the gap between the specification of the workflow and its implementation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<!--<h2>How to Use RenewGrass</h2>-->
In order to use RenewGrass, the following steps are required:
<ul>
<li>Install Renew:</li>
To install Renew, please refere to the official <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/TGI/renew/install.html">documentation</a>.
<li>Install Grass GIS from source:</li>
The following steps are for debian-based systems. 
First we need to download a copy of the source code. 
For this, svn (a revision control system) need to be installed.

$ sudo apt-get install svn

After a successful install of svn run:

$ sudo checkout https://svn.osgeo.org/grass/grass/branches/release\
branch_6_4grass64_release

After downloading the code, we need to compile it. There are many dependencies, which are necessary for Grass compilation for example: PROJ.4, GEOS
and GDAL.
Grass need to be configured before running (make and make install) by
executing the configure command. This generates a file with all the variables
(can/should be adjusted according to specific needs) that they will be used in
the compilation phase.
After ./configure ends successfully run:
$ make
$ make install
To run Grass (wich is not necessary, since it will be called directly from the
nets) simply use this command grass64.
<li>Set the variables</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
RenewGrass is a plug-in that can/must be integrated in Renew.
There are two ways to install a plug-in. 
If it comes in one single .jar file which includes a file named plugin.cfg, you can just copy the file in the renew2.4.x/plugins directory (if
you use the Mac OS X application bundle, this directory is located inside the application package at the path Contents/Resources/Java/plugins). 

If the plug-in comprises several files, one of which is the file plugin.cfg, then you can create a subdirectory below (e.g.
 renew2.4.x/plugins/myplugin and copy all files in this directory.
On the next startup, the plug-in system will find and include the plug-ins automatically. 
If you want to include the plug-in in the running system, use the load command.
The information mentioned above are taken from Renew's user guide, which can be found <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/TGI/renew/renew.pdf">here</a>.<br>
Users are advised to read it first prior using RenewGrass. 

The RenewGrass plug-in can be downloaded <a href="sources/renewgrass-2.4.zip">here</a>.
After downloading the file, it must be unzipped in the plugins directory. </p>
<h3>Install Grass GIS from source</h3>
lists the required steps to compile the Grass GIS (version 6) from
source. Installing from the binaries affects negatively on the plugin, since the
commands wrapper will not work properly. It also explains how to set up the
required variables as well as how to organize the data in a Grass database.
